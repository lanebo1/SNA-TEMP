# Distributed-Log-Analysis-Framework
Modern distributed systems generate large amounts of log data from various sources, making
effective analysis essential for monitoring, security, and optimization. This project introduces a
custom distributed log analysis framework based on the MapReduce paradigm, allowing scalable
log processing and aggregation across multiple nodes. Our system extracts key data such as the
most active IP addresses and endpoints using a microservices architecture, consisting of a Java
Spring Boot API gateway, Go-based analyzer, MongoDB, and a reliable messaging pipeline using
RabbitMQ. The framework has been tested using generated logs that are similar to those found in
the real world, and it provides an interactive dashboard. The dashboard focuses on extracting the
most active IP addresses or endpoints from server logs. This allows organizations to gain valuable
insights from their distributed system's data.

## Getting Started
